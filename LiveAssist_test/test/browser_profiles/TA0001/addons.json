Firefox users can see the memory usage in the add-on bar or the toolbar tool-tip. If memory usage reaches a certain threshold, the add-on bar display and the toolbar icon will turn red. You can quickly restart Firefox at any time by clicking on the add-on bar display or the toolbar icon. The memory threshold, check interval and add-on bar text colors are customizable. There is also an auto restart feature and a minimize memory feature.\n\nThis add-on uses the same memory values you will see in about:memory. It takes resident or private, whichever is higher.\n\nToolbar icon courtesy of Ken Saunders.
